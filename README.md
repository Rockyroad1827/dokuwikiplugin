## === quickcreate ===

QuickCreate is a plugin used to make pages fast in dokuwiki - by adding this plugin, a button will appear in the bottom right of your screen. click it to add a new page with a custom namespace and pagename.

+ If you wish for the page to be created in the root directory then leave the namespace blank, however if you would like the page to be under a custom namespace then you may enter one.
+ The pagename must be entered, this is so the form can work properly. you can not make a namespace and leave it empty as dokuwiki does not support it. a page must always be in a namespace.

- Once a page has been created it will be empty. if you leave the page once it has been created - the page will auto delete and you will have to make it again.
